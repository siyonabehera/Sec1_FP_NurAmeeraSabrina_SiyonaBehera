# College Major and Income Analysis: Does More Work Mean More Pay?

This repository contains the code, datasets, and visualizations for the project “Work-Life Balance vs. Earnings: Does More Work Mean More Pay?” The project analyzes how education level and college major group correlate with work hours and income, using data from Kaggle.

## Overview

This project explores the following research question:

Work-Life Balance vs. Earnings: Does More Work Mean More Pay?
We aim to investigate whether working more hours actually results in higher pay across different industries and education levels.

Why This Matters
Informed Decision-Making: Helps students and professionals evaluate trade-offs between hours worked and expected earnings.

Fair Compensation Design: Guides employers in assessing the efficiency and fairness of pay structures.

Policy Implications: Sheds light on productivity trends, diminishing returns from overwork, and long-term financial well-being.

Higher Pay ≠ Longer Hours: Major groups like Health and Engineering report high incomes without working the longest hours.
